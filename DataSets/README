Instructions for creating the data sets.

1. Unzip the contents of nasdaq_100 into the n100 directory.
2. Unzip the contents of qqq.zip into the n100 directory.
3. Run convert2csv.rb. It will merge the 140+ tables into a single table. It
   will construct a single csv (qqq_state.csv) for all 1-minute periods from
   the qqq quotes file that occured during normal trading hours.*
4. Then run random_split.rb. It will create 5 files qqq_state_0.csv through
   qqq_state_4.csv.


* Normal trading hours 930-1600. No effort toward identifying partial trading
  days.
